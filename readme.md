# RISCV simulator

A simulator for RISCV written in Rust.
I'm starting with the basic RV32I instructions and moving forward from there adding more
optional variants. We'll see how far I build it up.

## TODO

Currently working on implementing the basic instructions.
Need to test if it works on binaries.
